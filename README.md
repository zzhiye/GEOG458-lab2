The above map showcases Tweets throughout Washington State. It's evident that the map displays a pattern that has a large cluster of tweets on the west side of Washington and a small cluster of tweets on the east side of Washington. Starting with west Washington, it's expected that a large distribution of tweets would appear here considering cities such as Seattle, Tacoma, Bellevue, etc. holds most of Washington's population. Additionally, major attractions (e.g., Space Needle, Pike Place Market, and The Gum Wall), industries/companies (e.g., Boeing, Amazon, Microsoft), universities and colleges (e.g., University of Washington, Seattle University, and Bellevue College) are located on west Washington. For example, University of Washington is in Seattle, where the demographic are young college students that enjoys using social media platforms like Twitter. This is similar to the smaller cluster of tweets in east Washington since Spokane is the second most populated city in Washington. Furthermore, Washington State University is located in that area, which indicates a younger demographic that are likely to use Twitter.
